            <h3>Real-time Environment and Soil Monitoring</h3>
            <p>
                Real-time environment and soil monitoring is a game-changer in the agriculture industry. The main benefit is that during the time that data is being collected that errors can be corrected. The improvements of settings, operations, and protocol can be implemented, preventing huge losses while improving security, staff performance, equipment efficiency.

            <h3>Get Knowledge of Soil Parameters</h3>
            <p>
                Having data in real-time, using Nova Vector platform and sensors that are plugged in soil, saves a lot of time and resources to landowners because they have insight, using the dashboard, into the current values of soil temperature, humidity, pH, and NPK values.
                <br>
                The sensors can be plugged into the soil at different depths,  depending on the client's needs. 
                What once used to take days to examine with the Nova Vector platform is just a click away.

            <h3>Optimize Fertilizer Usage while Maximizing the Growthh</h3>
            <p>With real-time knowledge of soil parameters, the client can apply the fertilizers at the right rate, the right time and more accurately than before, therefore save resources but maximize the growth.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Set Notifications, KPI and Alerts</h3>
            <p>On Nova Vector platform, the client can set notifications, KPIs and Alerts for specific (or all) parts of the soil/ground, and he'll be informed immediately if the parameters have gone below/above the Warning or Error values, which will enable him to react instantly and mitigate costly risks</p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Connect to Weather Services and Optimize Irigation</h3>
            <p>Nova Vector platform offers the possibility to connect to Weather services and by predicting weather conditions, along with the current soil state, increase agricultural efficiency through irrigation process automation.
