            <h3>Real-time Insight into Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>
                Nova Vector platform has the potential to capture data that has eluded manufacturers for many years.
                The results are greater revenue earned from higher levels of compliance, manufacturing quality, and delighted customers.
                <br>
                Real-time data is the catalyst in making that happen by improving the quality of decisions, reaching a new level of accuracy, precision, and speed, prolonging the life of equipment, enabling higher inventory control accuracy and performance, and many more.

            <h3>OEE Dashboards</h3>
            <p>
                OEE – overall equipment effectiveness-  is one of the most holistic metrics an organization can use to measure an asset's performance. When it comes to finding improvements in cost and productivity, the overall equipment effectiveness metric does a great job of shedding light into the effectiveness of key resources.
                <br>
                By relying on real-time data provided by Nova Vector platform, manufacturers are gaining quicker insights and can determine which areas of availability, performance and quality are most impacting performance.

            <h3>Record and Clasify Stoppages</h3>
            <p>
                Recording and classifying stoppages is a simple process in which the operator working on the machine needs to press a corresponding LoRa button, which will send data to Nova Vector platform -and the platform will do the rest.
                <br>
                By recording and classifying stoppages using the Nova Vector platform, the manufacturer can gain new insight into how manufacturing equipment and machinery life spans can be improved. By combining real-time data with predictive analytics, it's possible to determine when a given machine will need repair and therefore prevent unnecessary stoppages and possible loss of time.

            <h3>Get Insight into Stoppage Type, Count and Duration</h3>
            <p>
                With Nova Vector recording and classifying stoppages, there is also the ability to take a look at all the collected(or real-time) data using a custom made Stoppage/Reason code report.
                <br>
                The report can be filtered as per client's wishes, but the most important filters would be production line, product and date/time. Using that information, the client can determine the situations in which he can improve planning as well as make a plan how to minimize number of unplanned stoppages.

    <h3>Realtime Data Visualization</h3>
    <p>
        Nova Vector platform has real-time data visualization using the dashboard, including custom reports, graphs and tables. 
        <br>
        Realtime data visualization is useful to both upper level managers who can now track what's going on in their factory through few clicks and react timely,  but also to the machine operators which can view their results in real-time and improve their work significantly.
        <br>
        Nova Vector dashboard can be accessed using mobile devices, tablets, laptops/PCs or even Smart TVs.

    <h3>Record Production Line Operators Engagement</h3>
    <p>
        Nova Vector platform can track production line operators engagement simply by using RFID readers through which the operator should pull through the id card that he owns.
        <br>
        The system will do the rest – match the operator with the corresponding production line & the plan that exists for that day and shift, enabling the upper management team to see, compare and improve operators engagement.

            <h3>Track Maintenance Crew Tasks and Results</h3>
            <p>
                Nova Vector platform has its own Tasks module, but can be integrated with external platforms too. 
                <br>
                Tracking maintenance crew tasks and results has never been easier with the only responsibility the maintenance crew has is to pull their id card through the RFID readers on production lines twice – on arrival and departure(when they fixed the issue).  
                <br>
                The system will do the rest – assign the crew member to the latest opened ticket for that production line, update the worklog and track spent time.
                <br>
                The upper management team can pull out maintenance crew tasks and results by pulling out the report from the platform, that will provide them with enough insights to improve that field area.

     <h3>Realtime Plan Execution Tracking</h3>
            <p>
                Nova Vector platform offers the possibility of creating manufacturing plans and targets with minimal effort, as well as tracking and changing the plan according to the real-time data the platform receives, therefore saving time and resources.
                <br>
                The client is able to see all necessary information, such as all the data he created – expected speed, product quantity, number of stoppages, shift start and end, production line start and end, next to the real-time data of what's actually done so far, which enables him to react in the moment and improve manufacturing process. 
                <br>
                After a certain amount of time, the platform will analyze the data for the client and point what would need to be changed in the planning structure, therefore helping with the planning optimization.
