            <h3>Nova Vector Industry 4.0 Platform</h3>
            <p>
            Nova Vector is a cutting-edge Industry 4.0 platform. It is a modular, scalable and secure platform that combines modern technologies which are building blocks of Industry 4.0:
            <br>- Internet of things
            <br>- Edge Computing
            <br>- Alerting
            <br>- Advanced Analytics and Realtime Reporting
            <br>- Computer Vision
            <br>- Machine Learning
            <br>- Blockchain and Smart Contracts
            <br><br> 
            The main goal of Nova Vector platform is to enable companies to connect existing or off the shelf devices, over any type of network. Once connected, Nova Vector platform will enable you to manage those devices, create KPI, alerts, plans and record human interaction with devices or area where sensors are deployed.

            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <p>
            Nova Vector is licensed under Apache License 2.0, so it's free to use in any of your commercial products. Nova Vector Platform can be deployed on-premise, in the private or public clouds. Service providers can host it as IaaS, SaaS or PaaS solution. 
            <br><br>
            Nova Edge, the IoT edge component of the Nova Vector Platform can be used on the network edge to provide eder computing capabilities and data processing near the data source, reducing latency and dependency on internet connection.

    <h3>Multi-Tenancy</h3>
    <p>
        Nova Vector Platform is developed as a system in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers. Each customer is called a tenant and can customize only the parts of the application which are assigned to his user role and user group.
        <br><br>
        Multi-tenant architecture integrates each tenant physically, but keeps them logically separated; meaning that a single instance of the software will run on one server or server farm and serve multiple tenants.
        With the use of roles the client is able to set restricted access to specific assets for a fine-grained management.

            <h3>Support for OAuth 2/ODIC </h3>
            <p>OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization and Nova Vector supports it, therefore enables you to provide Single Sign-On functionality for your clients.
            <br><br>
            This means that your applications don't have to deal with login forms, authenticating users, and storing users. Once logged-in, users don't have to login again to access a different application. This also applies to logout. 
            <br><br> 
            Nova Vector also enables you to login with social networks.

            <h3>Device and Asset Management</h3>
            <p>
                Device and Asset Management is the primary function of Nova Vector Platform. It is
                designed with the goal to enable you to connect any device or data source, to monitor and
                control them in a secure way.
                <br>
                The second equaly important function of Nova Vector Platform is to enable tracking of human and
                machine interaction and provide deeper insight into factory floor processes and production
                planning.
                <br><br>
                Entities that exist on Nova Vector platform:
                    <br>- IoT Related: Devices, Channels, Device Profiles, Commands, Alerts
                    <br>- User Realated: Users, User Groups, User Roles
                    <br>- General: Organizations, Products, Plans, KPI, Tasks, Employees, Work Positions

            <h3>Alerts, KPI, Planning </h3>
            <p>
            Nova Vector Platform enables users to create alerts based on the device, communication channel and metrics. Alerts can be configured to create tasks. Tasks are used to record human interaction with the platform, connected devices or physical evironment. Alerts can have separate thresholds for Notification, Warning and Error conditions.
            <br><br>
            If you need to monitor performance of the devices or production lines, with Nova Vector Platform you can create KPI and develop custom reports that monitor performace against set threshold.
            <br><br>
            In manufacturing, it is very important to have good planning and the ability to track the plan execution. Nova Vector Platform eables you to enter the plans for connected production lines and automaticaly track the plan execution, produced quanity and duration and nature of the stoppages.

            <h3>Organizations and  Products</h3>
            <p>
            You can create Organizations, Organization Types, and Organizational Hierarchy. Each Organization can have its parent, so admins can create organization charts that match their needs. Each Organization can be assigned with an external ID which is helpful for connecting with external systems such as ERP, billing, or others. You can also enable or disable planning for the Organization.
            <br><br> 
            With Nova Vector Platform, you can create products and define the metric on the connected device that determines what one product is. You can also assign external ID,  QR, or barcodes to products or different packaging of the product. The products can then be used to create KPI per product per production line.

            <h3>Microservice Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                Nova Vector Platform and Nova Edge are designed as a set of microservices. The microservice architecture consists of small, naturally divided, autonomous services that implement a single business capability.
                <br><br>
                Microservice architecture provides modular deployment and enables horizontal scaling of the system.
                Nova Vector packages microservices in Docker containers which can be deployed on a single server or top of the Kubernetes cluster.

            <h3>Realtime Data Visualization</h3>
            <p>
                When dealing with data on masive scale, the quality visualization module is a must.
                Nova Vector Platform has built-in full feature module for data visualization which enable users
                to get the knowledge on device behaviour at a glance.
                <br><br>
                Nova Vector Platform allows you to create and share custom dashboards with graphs, that can
                visualize the data coming from multiple devices in real-time. The data can be compared against
                pre defined KPIs.
                The users can automate KPI tracking or export the data to CSV or Excel format or as PDF file.

            <h3>Edge Computing Component</h3>
            <p>
            Nova Vector has an Edge Computing component, in which client data is processed at the periphery of the network, as close to the originating source as possible.
            <br>
            Rather than transmitting raw data to a central data center for processing and analysis, that work is instead performed where the data is actually generated -- whether that's a retail store, a factory floor, a sprawling utility or across a smart city. Only the result of that computing work at the edge, such as real-time business insights, equipment maintenance predictions or other actionable answers, is sent back to the main data center for review and other human interactions.
            <br>
            Nova Vector Industry 4.0 Platform has an integrated Edge Devices management server. Edge Management enables you to deploy and manage containerized services on edge devices.

            <h3>Function as a Service Module</h3>
            <p>Nova Vector offers FaaS module, which uses a serverless architecture to execute small, modular pieces of code – functions. The advantages of such module would   be:
                <br>- Simplified developer logistics - more agility, faster updates and more responsiveness to customer needs
                <br>- Highly scalable - FaaS model allows individual functions to be scaled automatically and independently based on their usage
                <br>- Lower Up-front costs
                <br>- Built-in Quality - significant benefits in terms of availability, tolerance, security and other maintenance tasks
