            <h3>Smart Building Core System</h3>
            <p>Nova Vector Smart Building Solution is modular, performant and secure system that consists of Server-side system and Edge component.
            <br>
            Server-side system acts as fleet management system for the Edge IoT devices. Server-side system can be deployed on premise or in the cloud. We support deployment on any cloud provider who supports Kubernetes.
            <br>
            Edge component is based on Linux Foundation EdgeX Foundry and enables users to connect any existing or new device to the system using any od the supported protocols.

     <br>EdgeX Foundry is an Open Source IoT framework that is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hardware and operating system (OS) agnostic enables you to use gateways running different OS choice</li>
                    <li>Multiple Southbound connections using a range of wired and wireless OT protocols via both gateways and smart sensors connecting directly to the Cloud</li>
                    <li>Northbound connectivity to multiple Cloud Systems and on-premise systems</li>
                    <li>Analytics and control at the Edge</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            Using EdgeX  in the Smart Building Automation Use Case you can one system to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Climate control - analytics, sensing, automation</li>
                    <li>Light level control - analytics, sensing, automation</li>
                    <li>Occupancy - building automation centered around real-time occupancy analytics</li>
                    <li>Energy Monitoring - real-time energy analytics and monitoring, identifying base consumption, variable consumption and maximum demand</li>
                </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Streming Analytics and Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Streaming analytics work by allowing organizations to set up real-time analytics computations on data streaming from applications, social media, sensors, devices, websites and more. Streaming analytics provide quick and appropriate time-sensitive processing along with language integration for intuitive specifications.
    Streaming analytics is essentially all about extracting business value from data in motion in the same way traditional analytics tools make use of data at rest.
    <br>
    Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn without being explicitly programmed. When applied to business data it can provide valuable insight on how seemingly unrelated events corelate.
