            <h3>Environment Monitoring</h3>
            <p>The main sources of atmospheric pollution include organic compounds, carbon compounds, and particulate matter (PM) produced by human activities, including nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and PM2.5, which can all seriously affect human health. Application of the IoT to monitor the air quality can provide sufficient data to allow the pollution sources to be located precisely. With characteristics that include on-line monitoring, target tracking, remote maintenance, and an on-line upgrade capability, the IoT can solve the problems of high-space-time-precision air monitoring efficiently.</p>

            <h3>LoRaWAN Networks</h3>
            <p>The LoRa IoT Environment Monitoring System consists of the following subsystems:
                <ul>
                    <li>LoRa IoT Gateway - wireless sensor hub and gateway to the Internet</li>
                    <li>Indoor Station - wireless temperature and humidity sensor</li>
                    <li>Outdoor Station - wireless temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor</li>
                    <li>Additional Use case specific sensors can be added</li>
                    <li>Legacy systems can be connected and integrated to provide</li>
                </ul>

    <h3>Streming Analytics and Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Environment Monitoring can greatly benefit from mondern analytics tools like Streming Analytics and Machine Learning. Streaming Analytics can provide relatime insight into enviromental data.
    Mashine Learning can provide valuable insight on how seemingly unrelated events corelate.</p>
