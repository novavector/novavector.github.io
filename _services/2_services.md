            <h3>Advanced Analytics</h3>
            <p>Advanced analytics is a part of data science that uses high-level methods and tools to focus on projecting future trends, events, and behaviors. This gives organizations the ability to perform advanced statistical models such as ‘what-if’ calculations, as well as future-proof various aspects of their operations.
            <br>The term is an umbrella for several sub-fields of analytics that work together in their predictive capabilities.
            <br>The major areas that make up advanced analytics are predictive data analytics, big data, and data mining. The process of advanced analytics includes all three areas at various times.</p>

    <h3>Streming Analytics</h3>
    <p>Streaming analytics work by allowing organizations to set up real-time analytics computations on data streaming from applications, social media, sensors, devices, websites and more. Streaming analytics provide quick and appropriate time-sensitive processing along with language integration for intuitive specifications.
    Streaming analytics is essentially all about extracting business value from data in motion in the same way traditional analytics tools make use of data at rest.
