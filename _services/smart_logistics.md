    <h3>Streming Analytics and Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Streaming analytics work by allowing organizations to set up real-time analytics computations on data streaming from applications, social media, sensors, devices, websites and more. Streaming analytics provide quick and appropriate time-sensitive processing along with language integration for intuitive specifications.
    Streaming analytics is essentially all about extracting business value from data in motion in the same way traditional analytics tools make use of data at rest.<br>
    Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn without being explicitly programmed. When applied to business data it can provide valuable insight on how seemingly unrelated events corelate.
