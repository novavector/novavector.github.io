            <h3>Blockchain</h3>
            <p>Blockchain is in its essence just another decentralized database. How ever the applications built on top of Blockchain and smart contracts are already revolutionizing various industries. More efficient, transparent, scalable and immutable enterprise blockchain products are being developed in healthcare, finance, supply chain management, insurance, transport, media, government and many more.

            <h3>Hyperledger</h3>
            <p>Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain infrastructure, originally Open sourced by IBM and Digital Asset, providing a modular architecture with a delineation of roles between the nodes in the infrastructure, execution of Smart Contracts (called "chaincode" in Fabric) and configurable consensus and membership services.

    <p>A Fabric Network comprises "Peer nodes", which execute chaincode, access ledger data, endorse transactions and interface with applications. "Orderer nodes" which ensure the consistency of the blockchain and deliver the endorsed transactions to the peers of the network, and MSP services, generally implemented as a Certificate Authority, managing X.509 certificates which are used to authenticate member identity and roles
    </p>
    <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
    <p>Smart contracts are computer protocols intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

    Gartner in its report: “Blockchain + WAN Edge = Leading the Digital Transformation” predicts that by 2030, 30% of the global customer base will be made up of things that use blockchain as a foundational technology to conduct commercial activity.
