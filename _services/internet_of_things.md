            <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
            <p>Internet of things represents a set of technologies used to connect, monitor and manage consumer and industrial devices.
            While idea is not new, it started to grow only presently when the electronics and telecom networks become affordable and the do not significantly increase the end price of the smart, connected device.
            IoT is in the core of the future development and has its applications in many domains of our life:

            <h3>LoRaWAN Networks</h3>
            <p>LoRa (short for long range) is a spread spectrum modulation technique derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology. LoRa devices and wireless radio frequency technology (LoRa Technology) is a long range, low power wireless platform that has become the de facto technology for Internet of Things (IoT) networks worldwide.

    <h3>Streming Analytics and Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>Streaming analytics work by allowing organizations to set up real-time analytics computations on data streaming from applications, social media, sensors, devices, websites and more. Streaming analytics provide quick and appropriate time-sensitive processing along with language integration for intuitive specifications.
    Streaming analytics is essentially all about extracting business value from data in motion in the same way traditional analytics tools make use of data at rest.
