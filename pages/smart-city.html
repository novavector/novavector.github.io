            <p class="paragraph-city">Revolutionizing water management, our Smart Water Solutions deploy non-intrusive Surface Mounted Sensors and advanced analytics for early leak detection. Result: substantial water savings, increased utility revenue, and heightened environmental sustainability. In many cases leakages in the pipes are not visible from the surface. It leads to excessive and unkneaded water consumption and loss of income for utility companies and local communities. Some case studies show that 44% of the water in Rome, Italy is wasted in unnoticed leakages. World average is 25-30% of water loss annually. There is direct impact to finance of utility companies and to environment. Explore the impact of our technical innovations in leak detection and precision irrigation for urban areas.</p>

            <h3 class="title-1-city">Smart Waste Management</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-1-city">Elevating urban waste management to new heights, our Smart Waste Solutions tackle inefficiencies in garbage collection head-on. Traditional methods lead to increased fuel costs and emissions, prompting our approach: sensors measuring fill-level on existing containers, real-time data for optimized truck routes, and a centralized platform for seamless coordination. The outcome? Significant fuel savings, enhanced sustainability, and a proven case in Rotterdam, Netherlands, where a similar solution reduced garbage truck mileage by 20%, converted static routes, and decreased the number of trucks needed. Explore our transformative examples, from preventing sewer blockages with real-time sewage level measurements to averting hazards through smart monitoring of manhole covers, ensuring safety and environmental friendliness in every aspect of urban waste management.</p>
