            <h4 class="title-2">Modular, Microservice Architecture
            </h4>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Just like Nova Vector Platform, the Nova Edge is designed as a set of microservices. The Nova Edge microservices can be divided into several logical groups.

                 Device Services provide connections to the devices and sensors.
                 Core Services are responsible for device management, sending commands to connected devices, and configuration of the edge server.
                 Supporting Services consist of Rule Engine, Scheduling, and Alerts and Notification services.</p>

            <h4 class="title-2">Realtime Data Processing on the Edge
            </h4>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Nova Edge enables data processing at the IoT edge. Device data streams can be forwarded to the built-in rules engine, where they can be transformed using SQL-like language. The rules engine output can be pushed to the Rest HTTP server, MQTT broker, EdgeX message bus, or log file.
                In addition to the rules engine, the system has Application Services that provide several standard functions for data transformation, including: Compression, conversion, encryption and Filtering Export.

            <h4 class="title-2">Edge Server Management
            </h4>
            <p class="paragraph-2">Nova Vector Platform has a container management component that can be used to manage edge servers. You deploy a management container on the edge server, which connects to Nova Vector platform and enables you to deploy docker containers or docker-compose scripts to the edge server.
                Using the integrated FaaS component, you can develop functions on the main server, package them as containers, and push them to the edge.
