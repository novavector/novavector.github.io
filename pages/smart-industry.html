            <p class="paragraph-industry">Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)  measures the percentage of planned production time that is truly productive. Many manufacturing lines are only 60% productive, meaning there are tremendous opportunities for improvement. Nova Vector's OEE Dashboards offer insights into overall equipment effectiveness, helping manufacturers swiftly identify and address performance bottlenecks and optimize cost and productivity. By relying on real-time data provided by Nova Vector platform, manufacturers are gaining quicker insights and can determine which areas of availability, performance and quality are most impacting performance.</p>
